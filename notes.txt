calibration matrix
Compute K <-- see slides. Nicer mapping from 2d to 3d and so on.
  Have the camera calebration step done!
  Nonlinear distortion patterns are managed by kinect for me!

x = KR[I| -C]x
[I| -C] is the shove on side of matrix


all epipolar lines converge on the epipole
Where the optical sensor of one camera would be imaged in the other cameras view.

that
r F j^t = 0 satsify the epipolar line << see reading for why this is the case.
Once we know f, fix one of the things, then can calculate the other cordnates.

Can expand out rFj
You can scale F. So there are only 8 points needed. Recover f beyond a scale factor. no absolute??

Once you get f and know K its easy to etract out rotations and translation between two cameras. See readings. 4 different possible. Don't know magnitude of translation.


Need some helpful functions to convert between differnt spaces.
Know point in view 1, lies on epipolar line. Slide it around on view two until it matches

Ask paul for the name of that subset of 8 points???? << same as other algorithms
